# Progress

## What Works
- Project setup with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Basic application structure using app directory layout
- Core UI components from Shadcn UI library
- Firebase configuration for authentication
- Initial login/signin page implementation with Google OAuth
- Basic API structure for question generation
- User data storage in Firestore after successful authentication
- Error handling for Firestore operations
- Initial UI for interview settings form (`interview-page`) with inputs for role, experience, category, tech stack, and count.

## What's Left to Build
- Complete authentication flow with Firebase
  - Implement Firestore security rules for data protection
  - Add additional authentication providers if needed
- User profile and preference management
- Connect interview settings UI to the Gemini API for question generation
- Implement the actual interview session experience (Q&A interface, displaying questions, handling responses)
- Response evaluation and feedback mechanism
- Progress tracking and analytics
- History of past interview sessions
- Settings and configuration options
- Deployment pipeline and production readiness

## Current Status
As of April 24, 2025, the project is in early development. The foundation has been laid with Next.js, TypeScript, and Firebase integration. We have implemented Google OAuth authentication with Firestore integration to store user profiles after successful authentication. The UI for configuring interview settings (job role, experience, tech stack, etc.) on the `interview-page` has been created.

The application structure follows Next.js conventions with the app directory approach. Basic UI components are in place using Shadcn UI. Authentication flow with Google has been implemented along with user data storage in Firestore. The next major step is to integrate the interview settings form with the backend API to generate questions.

## Known Issues
- Firestore security rules need to be implemented to prevent unauthorized access
- Need to handle potential Firebase quota limitations
- Interview settings form currently logs data; needs API integration.
- Question generation API needs completion
- User profile management needs enhancement
- Interview session Q&A experience incomplete
- Routing structure needs refinement
- Mobile responsiveness needs testing

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **Initial Framework Selection**: Started with Next.js 14 for its server components and app directory structure
2. **UI Component Decision**: Selected Shadcn UI for its customizable, accessible components
3. **Database Approach**: Chose Firebase for simplicity and integrated authentication
   - Implemented Firestore for user profile storage using setDoc with merge option
   - Using user.uid as document ID in users collection for direct document access
4. **LLM Selection**: Selected Gemini API for its balance of capabilities and cost
5. **Project Structure**: Adopted app directory for improved routing and layouts
6. **Error Handling Strategy**: Implemented nested try/catch blocks to gracefully handle authentication and database errors
